&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I initially wanted to write this essay on the importance of voting in a free republic, I had trouble finding a proper hook. I have decided to tailor this as partially a response to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38rO5OzHEOE), a video by Michael Moreno making the case that democracy, as a system is evil. In addition to addressing Moreno's stance, I want to explore how and why America and most of the free world have adopted democratic systems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems are tools, they cannot be good or evil. Even systems such as communism, which has been decried as absolutely evil has its niche in raising children. A tool such as capitalism, when used by a short-sighted oaf, can lead to supply shortages and strained supply chains as we've recently seen when outsourcing labor to China, though it could be argued that those trade arrangements were a result of cronyism rather than laissez faire capitalism. I disagree with Moreno vehemently when he says that the failure of democracy is a system problem and not a people problem, to the point of irritance. The founding fathers envisioned the republic as a distribution of power among the citizens within the government and expected that a citizen who chose to wield that power would take up the associated responsibilities. In forming the union, the country has made huge mistakes, but the system was built with provisions to rectify these mistakes, and empowered individuals to uphold justice, first through dialogue and then through violence if necessary.
