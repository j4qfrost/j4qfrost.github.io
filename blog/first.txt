	Well, I've graduated from UCSD. I definitely won't miss that place. Building attachments was never easy for me, but regardless I only ever saw college as a way to get that piece of paper saying that I can do X job and I should be paid Y dollars. In terms of technical skills, I've definitely learned how to Google better. I think I've made minimal improvement in my overall knowledge. In the academic sense, I think college was zero sum for me. My parents definitely shouldn't have spent thousands of dollars putting me through school, but they wanted to do it, so I guess I'll try to make the most of the degree. One bright side is that I've learned how to deal with different types of people better, but people suck anyway, so not too much net change.

	Now that we're done with all the depressing shit, I can put school behind me and focus on working on cool projects. I'm assuming someone is reading this (doubt it, though that would kind of make me crazy), so I will be making improvements to the website to make it look a bit prettier (for me) and interactive (for you). This is the overall background task that'll probably be going on all summer long. As for actual projects I'll be continuing some Discord bot projects that I left unfinished due to school scheduling, a game project with a long time friend, and a commission using some Google AI framework (lots of studying ahead). A kid named AJ wants to learn some cool stuff too, so I need to prep some lessons/projects for him.

	On the entertainment side, I've been pretty surprised by the quality of this season's anime. I still need to catch up on some of the series. Hopefully I have time to finish Persona 5 and Nier. I've already paid for convention tickets. Yep, that's pretty much it.

	My summer is pretty set. Though I'm a bit disappointed I don't have a stable salary, I'm working on projects I care about, so fuck it! I'm free from the public education system!
